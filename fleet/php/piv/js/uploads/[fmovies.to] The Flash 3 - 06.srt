1
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:03,016
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,794
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:08,230
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:10,999
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,636
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:16,838
After defeating Zoom
and saving the multiverse,

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,440
I ran back in time and created

8
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:20,409
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

9
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:22,177
I restored the timeline to how it was,

10
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:24,312
only to find things weren't as I left them.

11
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,548
I brought new threats to our world,

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,151
and I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

13
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:31,253
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:33,388
Previously on "The Flash"...

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,423
What is that?

16
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:35,657
Another epidermal husk,

17
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,392
a fully-intact human pelt.

18
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:39,428
Do we have any theories
as to what's causing them?

19
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,863
- I am Alchemy.
- Well, what do you want?

20
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:44,766
To help people achieve their true potential.

21
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:47,235
I know you want this more than anything,

22
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:49,504
but you have to face the fact
that it might not happen.

23
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:51,473
There's a whole multiverse
of Harrison Wells out there.

24
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,175
- Call me HR.
- You're a fake.

25
00:00:53,177 --> 00:00:55,043
Let me prove my worth.

26
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:57,579
If I fail, I will right back to my Earth.

27
00:00:57,581 --> 00:00:59,815
If I succeed, I will have
done some good with my life.

28
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:01,416
Caitlin, these powers you have,

29
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:03,151
the more you use them,

30
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:05,821
the more difficult
they're going to be to reverse.

31
00:01:07,357 --> 00:01:08,657
I'm fast,

32
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,792
really fast.

33
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:12,427
I might even be the fastest man alive.

34
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:13,995
And when I'm running,

35
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:16,598
there's no greater feeling in the world.

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,568
I can move through the city
like a guardian angel,

37
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,002
protecting people who need me.

38
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:28,410
Whoa, you gotta slow down.

39
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:30,111
And watch where you're going, okay?

40
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:32,647
- Okay.
- Okay.

41
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:33,648
Cool skateboard, though.

42
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,850
Thanks.

43
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,353
They even have a name for me.

44
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:40,255
They call me "Kid Flash."

45
00:01:40,257 --> 00:01:41,690
Kid Flash?

46
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:43,091
Yeah, the name needs some work, but, Dad,

47
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:45,293
I'm telling you, it all just felt so real

48
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,796
like it was actually happening.

49
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:49,798
And how often are you getting these dreams?

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,132
Uh, last couple nights.

51
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:53,001
Last couple?

52
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:54,269
Wally, this is exactly

53
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,238
what Frankie Kane said happened to her.

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,640
She had dreams, a lot of painful ones,

55
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:00,775
and then she started hearing
Alchemy's voice in her head

56
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:02,544
- until she became Magenta.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:04,179
This is totally different, Dad.

58
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,314
No. No, it's not.

59
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:07,616
Yes, it is.

60
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:08,950
I'm a speedster in my dreams.

61
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,186
I'm not an evil split personality.

62
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:12,988
I'm helping people, not hurting them.

63
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,689
Dad, this could mean that

64
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:17,759
my powers are finally manifesting.

65
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:20,428
No, I think this means
that you have a lot in common

66
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,865
right now with people who either
ended up in prison or dead.

67
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,001
Except for the fact that
I got hit by the dark matter

68
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:27,769
from the particle accelerator explosion,

69
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,337
just like Jesse.

70
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:34,342
I'm going to class.

71
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,216
Hey, Julian, do you want me to get started

72
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:42,851
on the DNA analysis for you?

73
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:45,420
Why would I need you to do that?

74
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:47,088
I don't know, I just

75
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,124
figured we worked so well
together last time.

76
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,560
What, that I'd want to do it again?

77
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,328
One shared case and one shared drink

78
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,597
does not make us mates, okay?

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,598
Miss Horton.

80
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,699
Mr. Allen.

81
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,234
- Mr. Albert.
- Morning.

82
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:00,302
New one?

83
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:02,337
Uh, yeah, number six.

84
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,872
Found it last night.

85
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:05,473
Well, this should
come as a welcome surprise.

86
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:06,908
You've been reassigned to meta-human

87
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,476
crime scene investigation full-time.

88
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:09,878
Full-time?

89
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,413
We're pouring all the resources we can

90
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:13,281
into figuring out this
husk problem, especially

91
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:14,616
considering the last one turned out to be

92
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,217
that evil speedster, The Rival.

93
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,986
Any questions, concerns,
you guys direct them

94
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:19,087
to Judge Hankerson, yeah?

95
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:20,689
All right. Thank you.

96
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:23,758
Joe.

97
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,427
- Cecile.
- Hi.

98
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:26,928
I didn't know you were gonna be over here.

99
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,564
Any excuse I have
to run into you, I take it.

100
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,568
You know, I'm really looking
forward to tomorrow night.

101
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,569
So am I.

102
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,604
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

103
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,606
Okay, good, then I, uh,

104
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,140
- I'll see you then.
- All right.

105
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:44,012
Yo. Is that what I think it was?

106
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,580
You asked her to movie night with us?

107
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:46,815
That's awesome. When did you do that?

108
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:48,450
How'd you do it?

109
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:49,751
As much as I'd like to gossip with you

110
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,353
like a teenager right now,

111
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:53,355
there's something else
we need to talk about.

112
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,756
What?

113
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,024
Wally.

114
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:58,059
He's been having dreams.

115
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:59,194
Dreams?

116
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,829
Saving people,

117
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:02,197
becoming a speedster.

118
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,065
He called himself Kid Flash.

119
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:07,335
Kid Flash, he...
he said that name, specifically?

120
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:08,803
He's in trouble, isn't he?

121
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:10,772
If Wally's having dreams of being Kid Flash,

122
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:12,474
then he's in trouble,

123
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:15,176
yeah, but don't worry,
okay, we'll figure it out.

124
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:17,746
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

Synced and corrected by oykubuyuk

126
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,786
We have a problem.

127
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:26,454
Yeah, we do. He's still here.

128
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:29,691
Cisco, comedy of the obvious.

129
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:32,894
I made a pact to justify
my presence on your Earth

130
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:36,364
and I think I got something.

131
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,866
- We're all ears.
- Okay.

132
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,969
I read every news report
I can get my hands on.

133
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:42,270
And I have come to the conclusion

134
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:43,772
that this very operation

135
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:45,407
is a ticking time-bomb.

136
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,908
What do you mean?

137
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,410
You can't spend all your time working on...

138
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:50,445
working on whatever... whatever this is.

139
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:53,281
This... this is a very delicate

140
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,884
set of power-dampening cuffs.

141
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,619
We need them to stop the meta-humans.

142
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:59,554
My point exactly.

143
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:00,922
It's not gonna be long

144
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,791
before people start
putting the pieces together

145
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:04,526
and figure out what you're doing here.

146
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:06,661
You're working with The Flash.

147
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:08,129
Okay, so what's your idea?

148
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,131
The perfect disguise.

149
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:13,168
We reopen this laboratory

150
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,806
and I become the face of
the new S.T.A.R. Labs

151
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:19,974
Museum.

152
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,143
There's only one problem with that.

153
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,445
It's your face.

154
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:24,646
You're kind of a known murderer

155
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:26,347
around these parts.

156
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:28,216
You see, the evil Wells,

157
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:31,319
not to be confused with
the dick-ish but not evil Wells,

158
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,855
he confessed to killing Barry's mother.

159
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:35,724
So basically, if you step foot

160
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:38,393
outside this lab, you'll be arrested.

161
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:40,929
What... you're just telling me
this now, you two rascals?

162
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:42,731
What about the cryptogram?
What about the message?

163
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,032
Come to this Earth. Get a fresh start.

164
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,433
Well, what about your résumé

165
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,836
as a world-renowned genius scientist?

166
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,273
That's a good point. I guess we're even.

167
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,375
If a string is in a knot,
patience will untie it.

168
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:56,678
Patience can do lots of things.
Have you ever tried it?

169
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,913
My dear ma used to say that
to me all the time

170
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:00,415
any time I had a problem.

171
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:01,983
Now I have a problem.

172
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:04,819
I guess I'm gonna use that adage
to figure it out.

173
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,323
S.T.A.R. Labs Museum, think about it.

174
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:11,826
You think everyone on Earth-19
is missing crayons in the box,

175
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,995
or just him?

176
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,800
Paging Dr. Snow.

177
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:21,803
Wow, you are out of it. Sorry.

178
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:24,506
This have anything to do
with your recent visit with mom?

179
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:26,508
I just... I haven't been sleeping well,

180
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,176
but I'm okay.

181
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,444
Coffee?

182
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:30,678
Perfect.

183
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:41,589
So I did have powers?

184
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:42,690
I was Kid Flash?

185
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:45,794
In Flashpoint, yes.

186
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,629
I knew that this was happening.

187
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,230
Why didn't you tell me before?

188
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:50,498
Because...

189
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,634
Because why?

190
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:54,569
All right, fine, Wally, it, look...

191
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:56,738
in that timeline,

192
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,373
you were fighting The Rival.

193
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,707
Edward Clariss?

194
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,309
Edward Clariss, yeah.

195
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,610
You couldn't stop him.

196
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:04,512
There was no S.T.A.R. Labs.

197
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:06,281
There was no team to help you.

198
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:07,882
It was just you and Iris.

199
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:10,552
The two of you were a brother-sister

200
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:13,454
superhero crime-fighting team.

201
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:16,157
Why didn't you tell us this before?

202
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,927
You didn't want to know
about your Flashpoint lives.

203
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,628
But look, listen to me,

204
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,398
you got hurt, all right?

205
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,933
You got hurt bad.

206
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:26,401
So what?

207
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,469
That's that me, it's not this me.

208
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:30,471
And I want to be a speedster.

209
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:31,973
I... I want to be a flash.

210
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,908
No, no, no, you don't.

211
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,343
Yes, I do.

212
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:36,744
You're not hearing what he's saying.

213
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:37,879
He's telling us it's not safe.

214
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,581
Who cares what Barry's saying?

215
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,115
How do we even know he's telling the truth?

216
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,984
Wally, come on, this isn't because of

217
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:45,353
the particle accelerator,
it's because of Dr. Alchemy.

218
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:47,422
It's the same thing
that happened to Frankie Kane.

219
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,790
- You don't know that.
- Yes, we do.

220
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,092
And we need to try
to keep it from happening.

221
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:53,294
Why don't we just say
what this is really about?

222
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:55,163
You're okay with Barry having powers;

223
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:56,631
you're okay with Barry running into danger,

224
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,932
fighting all these metas.

225
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,767
He can screw up over and over again

226
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,937
You're okay with all of it
because he's Barry.

227
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:04,973
But you won't give me
the same amount of leeway

228
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:06,241
because at the end of the day,

229
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:08,142
you just don't trust me.

230
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:10,011
You know that's not true, Wally.

231
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:11,980
I don't need you fighting
my dad's battles for him.

232
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:14,382
Say it, Joe.

233
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:17,385
You don't trust me, do you?

234
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:19,020
Wally...

235
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:20,221
That's what I thought.

236
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:24,025
Hey, hey...

237
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,600
No. No, you're not listening to me.

238
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:34,369
I said the shares are undervalued

239
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:38,539
so if the stock drops,
you should buy more, not less.

240
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,608
No, that... that's not how it works.

241
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,277
Look, just look at its balance sheet.

242
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:50,818
If you sell now, you're going
to lose a lot of money.

243
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,187
I understand that.

244
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:54,722
Of course it's your money.

245
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:57,292
Just hold onto it then.

246
00:08:57,294 --> 00:09:00,295
You know what? If you're not gonna listen...

247
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,068
Petechiae around the eye,
the crushed larynx.

248
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:24,298
This poor chap has got

249
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,366
fingerprints all round his neck.

250
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,619
He's clearly been strangled.

251
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:28,021
I heard multiple witnesses

252
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,622
said the man was attacked by a shadow.

253
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:31,190
Huh.

254
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:32,659
So a meta from Neverland's made the trip

255
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,027
to Central City Fabulous.

256
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,461
So far there's no forensic evidence

257
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:36,696
that there was an assailant.

258
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:39,499
No laceration marks. No fingernail marks.

259
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,401
No DNA evidence underneath
the fingernails even?

260
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:42,769
Nothing yet, we'll have to wait and see.

261
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:44,671
There's always something.

262
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:46,739
Bag the body up and
I'll meet you back at the lab.

263
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,940
- Yeah.
- See ya.

264
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:50,076
Oh, and Julian, um,

265
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:52,378
I'm going to that movie in the park thing

266
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,949
with Joe and his... or my...
Iris and some other friends.

267
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:59,252
Uh, if you felt like going,
it starts at 8:00.

268
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:01,220
We're all a bunch of nerds, so

269
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:02,955
you'll fit right in.

270
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:04,924
Well, that's a very enticing offer, Allen,

271
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:07,093
but I'm actually seeing
my girlfriend tonight, so.

272
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:09,862
Oh, you have a girlfriend?
I didn't know that.

273
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:12,498
I'm sure there's lots
about me that you don't know.

274
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,267
- Cheerio.
- Yeah.

275
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,002
- Albert.
- Detective.

276
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:17,603
- Hey.
- Anything?

277
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:20,206
With the... uh, nothing yet, at least.

278
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,941
Have you seen Wally this morning?

279
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,176
No. Why?

280
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,144
He left the house in a huff.

281
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,546
He won't answer my calls.

282
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:28,181
Iris is out there looking for him right now.

283
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:29,749
Did you want me to run around the city?

284
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:32,518
Maybe if I can't get ahold of him.

285
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,620
What Wally said, it's partially true.

286
00:10:34,622 --> 00:10:36,622
I didn't answer his question because

287
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:38,157
I... I don't trust him with these powers

288
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,992
the same way I trust you with them.

289
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:42,361
You got to talk to him about that.

290
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:44,764
You know, tell him why, especially now.

291
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,766
I will, I mean, just gotta find him first.

292
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:48,367
Look, I'll just keep calling him.

293
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:49,702
He's got to answer at some point, right?

294
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:50,937
Man, I feel bad, too.

295
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,071
It's your first date with Cecile

296
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:53,206
and you got to worry about this.

297
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,774
Don't worry about that.

298
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:57,176
That's one part of my life I can control.

299
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,516
Yes?

300
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:04,951
Have you seen HR?

301
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:06,986
Maybe he's meditating in his room.

302
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:08,554
No, he's not there.

303
00:11:08,556 --> 00:11:10,456
HR, you're needed in the Speed Lab, now.

304
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,926
He could be doing inversion
stretches in the intake.

305
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,161
You saw that too, huh?

306
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:16,829
HR! He's not there.

307
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,331
Probably just brewing another pot of coffee.

308
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,133
- It's all he drinks.
- Not that either.

309
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:22,969
Okay. Why do you need him so badly?

310
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:25,271
He's going through my stuff, but now...

311
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:28,407
He's just being stupid about it.

312
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:30,576
Stupid about what?

313
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:33,446
God, I swear I fixed the security system.

314
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:34,647
Who the hell are you?

315
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:35,748
HR.

316
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,219
Apologies.

317
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,058
HR.

318
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,261
See? Ah. What you've just been witness to

319
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:50,563
was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.

320
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:52,932
Okay, I see what's going on here.

321
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:56,035
You don't have facial transmogrification

322
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:57,203
on this planet, do you?

323
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:58,771
No, we certainly do not.

324
00:11:58,773 --> 00:12:00,606
Well then,

325
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:02,175
it's a good thing for me
I found this little contraption

326
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:03,609
in my satchel... forgot I brought it.

327
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,444
It's so fun.

328
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:07,313
So fun? How does this work?

329
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,115
Light refraction technology.

330
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:10,616
Light refraction?

331
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:11,918
I think... I don't... Randolf,

332
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,619
my... business partner,

333
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:15,221
he's sort of more with the science.

334
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:17,390
But this little sucker
is gonna go a long way

335
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:19,859
to solving my Harrison Wells facial issues.

336
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:23,229
I'm gonna hang onto this
until I get my power cuffs back.

337
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:25,431
What, your power cuffs?

338
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,500
Your meta-human power-dampening cuffs?

339
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:29,101
Those very ones, the ones that are

340
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:30,636
missing all of a sudden.

341
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:32,305
What... you think... you think I took them?

342
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:34,140
I didn't take them.
What do I need cuffs for?

343
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:35,975
I just got to this Earth. I came alone.

344
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:38,277
I haven't met anyone yet;
it's gonna take a while,

345
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,746
even when I do meet them,
to get to the cuff stage.

346
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:43,616
Hey, guys?

347
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,752
Guys, I need you in the Cortex.

348
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:49,555
Killed by a shadow? That's a new one.

349
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:51,457
Maybe that's what killed Edward Clariss.

350
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,059
Clariss was a meta-human.

351
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:55,361
This victim doesn't appear to be.

352
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:57,430
Do we know if this shadow meta is from the

353
00:12:57,432 --> 00:13:00,066
particle accelerator explosion
or from Dr. Alchemy?

354
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:01,267
Not yet, no.

355
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:02,468
We actually haven't found any

356
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,070
evidence to process.

357
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:06,472
If only we had a way, Francisco,

358
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:07,707
to see what happened.

359
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:09,242
Where was the crime scene located?

360
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:11,177
In Chubbuck, uh, Palmer and Racine,

361
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,546
around 11:00 last night.

362
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,449
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

363
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:17,483
That's gonna give me night terrors.

364
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:19,485
- Shade.
- What?

365
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,487
We had a meta-hominid on my planet

366
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:22,655
who could do virtually the same thing,

367
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:24,156
called himself "Shade."

368
00:13:24,158 --> 00:13:26,459
What did he do, throw
his side-eye at his enemies?

369
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:28,160
No, I know, it's a terrible nickname, right?

370
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:30,730
But what Shade could do was
vibrate at such a high frequency

371
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:33,633
he created the illusion
that he was a shadow.

372
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:35,468
That's how I phase.

373
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,836
Do you think he's doing the same thing?

374
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:38,004
He has to be.

375
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,171
Heat signature's fluctuating.

376
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:40,907
Red shift is ridiculous.

377
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,541
Okay, so he is.

378
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:45,044
He must be slowing down his
molecules whenever he attacks.

379
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:48,180
So we just have to figure out
a way to keep them slowed down,

380
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:49,815
and that should be enough to grab him.

381
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:51,150
All right, can you get started?

382
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:52,451
Okay, but, like, right this minute?

383
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:54,020
Yeah, I'm sor... we just...

384
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:56,989
we gotta stop this guy fast
so we can focus on Alchemy.

385
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:59,392
Wally has been having

386
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:02,194
dreams about being a speedster,

387
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:05,164
Alchemy dreams.

388
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,933
He was a speedster in Flashpoint?

389
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:11,737
Anyone else gonna have powers
we should know about?

390
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:13,539
No.

391
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,374
All right. I'm gonna work on Shade.

392
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,076
- I'll supervise.
- You're gonna find my cuffs.

393
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:18,811
I'll have to find some cuffs.

394
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:20,012
All right, I got to get back to work

395
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:21,714
before Julian loses his mind.

396
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:28,854
Wally, it's your dad, again.

397
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,423
Just give me a call back, all right?

398
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:32,491
Or a text, I just need to know you're okay.

399
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:34,026
I'm okay.

400
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:36,062
Wally.

401
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,096
You can't do that.

402
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:39,665
You can't just disappear.

403
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,100
I just wanted to let you know

404
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:42,969
I'm fine, so.

405
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,037
Come here.

406
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:54,380
Listen, you were right.

407
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:57,650
I do treat Barry differently
than I treat you.

408
00:14:57,652 --> 00:15:00,019
But not because I think
Barry's better than you.

409
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:01,454
Then why?

410
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,723
Wally, you're a lot like I was as a kid.

411
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,691
You're fearless and you take risks

412
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,960
and that makes you
a handful just like I was.

413
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,763
And now you're getting powers.

414
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:13,399
That alone would make me nervous

415
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:15,901
because I know what I
would have done if I got powers.

416
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:18,738
But you're not getting your speed

417
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,473
the same way Barry got his.

418
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:21,807
You're getting your speed the way

419
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,110
Magenta and The Rival got theirs.

420
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:26,579
So it's not that I don't
trust you, Wally, it's just

421
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,315
I don't trust what's
going on with you right now.

422
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,484
And that scares the living hell out of me.

423
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,252
I know, Dad.

424
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,021
I get it.

425
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:36,355
Okay, so

426
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:37,556
let's get you to S.T.A.R. Labs

427
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:40,726
- and see what we can do.
- All right.

428
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:44,530
Wallace.

429
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,098
Wallace West.

430
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:50,536
Ah!

431
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,806
Wally.

432
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,574
Wally!

433
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:01,013
Hey, Cisco.

434
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,515
Yes?

435
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:06,185
I took your cuffs.

436
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:07,520
Why?

437
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:08,687
Because I need them.

438
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,556
Is... is this some sort of, um,

439
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:13,325
bold fashion choice 'cause
you're not a meta-hu... hu...

440
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,361
human.

441
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:16,629
Surprise.

442
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,170
It started a few months ago.

443
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,571
That's why you went to see your mom,

444
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,705
to see if she could help you.

445
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:28,207
But she can't.

446
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,775
I've run every test.

447
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,610
There's nothing that anyone can do.

448
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:34,613
I need a favor.

449
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:38,317
I need you to vibe me in the future

450
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,520
because I need to know if I become...

451
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:44,356
her.

452
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,292
You're not gonna become her.

453
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:48,961
Okay, just because you have these powers

454
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,664
doesn't mean you're gonna
turn into Killer Frost.

455
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,132
I think it might.

456
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:54,733
Please?

457
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,303
I just need to know for sure.

458
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:59,038
I need to know if I become evil

459
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,207
because if I do, I have to leave

460
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,308
and never come back.

461
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,371
And?

462
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:34,006
I didn't see anything.

463
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:36,041
You're fine.

464
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,543
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

465
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:42,815
Please, um,

466
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:45,417
don't tell anyone about this yet, okay?

467
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,986
- Of course.
- Okay.

468
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:00,031
According to this,
all your vitals are fine, Wally.

469
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,832
Wally, what did you see?

470
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,801
I was Kid Flash again, but

471
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,469
this time it wasn't a good dream.

472
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:09,206
I was fighting The Rival
at some abandoned sawmill.

473
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,874
That's what happened in Flashpoint

474
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,176
before you got hurt.

475
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,344
They're not just dreams,

476
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,279
they must be memories of that life.

477
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:17,381
More and more people are getting powers.

478
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:18,949
Okay, so how do we stop this?

479
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:20,918
I mean, is there any stopping it even?

480
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,587
If Alchemy could reach you at CCPD,

481
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:25,055
he could probably reach you
from anywhere, right?

482
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:26,623
I have a suggestion.

483
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,158
Why don't we throw Wallace in the pipeline

484
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,493
until we figure this situation out.

485
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:31,095
You want to lock him up?

486
00:18:31,097 --> 00:18:32,363
Yeah, I agree with Joe, we lock him up

487
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:34,298
because think about this.

488
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,800
We can't stop Alchemy from
getting into Wallace's head,

489
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,003
but we put him in the pipeline,
then we control the situation

490
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:41,071
from there on out.

491
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:42,506
As much as I don't like it, Dad,

492
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,975
maybe he's not wrong.

493
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,643
But only till we figure out

494
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:47,811
a better way to make you safe.

495
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:49,246
Yeah, I agree with Joe.

496
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,749
I'm gonna cancel this movie with Cecile.

497
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:53,150
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, wait, wait,

498
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:55,019
you've got a date with Cecile?

499
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,520
Yeah, I was gonna bring her

500
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:58,355
to movie in the park tonight.

501
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:59,957
Well, don't not go.

502
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,859
You've put your life on hold
for us long enough.

503
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:03,193
Yeah, Dad, he's right, I mean,

504
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:06,030
go be Joe West; you're always Dad.

505
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:07,965
Yeah, we'll stay with Wally,
and make sure nothing happens.

506
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,067
I told her all of you were coming with me.

507
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:11,502
Am I gonna be the only one that shows up?

508
00:19:11,504 --> 00:19:14,538
Uh, I would love to see a movie.

509
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,507
- What movie is this?
- "The Shining."

510
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,343
"The Shining," oh, I love that movie.

511
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:20,978
That movie freaks you out.

512
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,047
You have never made it past
the part with the Grady twins.

513
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,748
That's... that's... that was...

514
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,849
I was younger.

515
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,518
Why don't I go with you?

516
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,552
You sure you don't want stay...

517
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,686
No, I want to be with you.

518
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,255
Either way, the more the merrier.

519
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,689
Let's do it.

520
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:34,291
Hell, this will be
great fodder for my novel.

521
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,160
Hold on, you guys didn't tell him about?

522
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:37,694
Joe, no.

523
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:38,829
They... they told me,

524
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:41,065
finally, the little scamps.

525
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,367
But I think that I've worked my way

526
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,502
around that little problem.

527
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:47,805
Watch this.

528
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:51,442
Whoa.

529
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:53,677
Oh, um, let me just...

530
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:56,847
- What... ah...
- What did you do?

531
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,315
Did you just neuralyze us?

532
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:00,117
No, I gave you a simple retinal adjustment

533
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,120
so all of you can see me, HR,

534
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:05,823
while the rest of the world sees...

535
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:10,794
Randolf Morgan.

536
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:13,063
Joe, I promise,
I'll be so... I'll be so quiet.

537
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:15,265
You won't even know I'm there.
Silent observer.

538
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:16,733
All right.

539
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:18,969
Wally, keep me posted.

540
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:20,070
Yeah, I'll be fine.

541
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:21,138
Just go have fun.

542
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,072
That's great.

543
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,943
All right, we want to be 2/3 to the back,

544
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:27,945
- right in the middle.
- That's a very small screen.

545
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:29,746
Like, I don't know if we're
gonna be able to see from...

546
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:31,615
No, HR, the screen is perfect, okay?

547
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:33,317
- We'll be able to see fine.
- But we're so far...

548
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,685
That's where the engineer sits when

549
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,487
- he mixes the sound, all right?
- All right.

550
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,021
When you want to get the
Kubrick experience, that's...

551
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,023
- All right, yeah.
- The sweet spot, right there.

552
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,525
I don't know, maybe we get a
little closer, like right by...

553
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:42,826
Why don't you let us worry about the seats?

554
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:43,994
You take care of the snacks and the drinks.

555
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:45,863
Great idea.

556
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,197
Any time.

557
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,732
Oh, I don't...

558
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:50,801
I'm pretty sure they're

559
00:20:50,803 --> 00:20:53,137
not gonna take the money from my Earth.

560
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:54,571
- I don't think.
- What?

561
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:56,473
- What is this?
- That's a helbing.

562
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:57,641
Here's what you're gonna do.

563
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,376
You're gonna get us what we need,

564
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:00,811
you're gonna do that, go over
to that stand over there.

565
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:02,412
- Great idea.
- You're gonna get us some

566
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:06,116
- licorice sticks, some Jujubes.
- Licorice... Juju...

567
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:07,484
Yeah, and coffee.

568
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:08,485
Do you want anything?

569
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:10,687
- No thanks.
- Okay.

570
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:12,322
Okay.

571
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:13,624
You okay, Cisco?

572
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:14,992
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

573
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:16,493
just trying to deal with HR.

574
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:17,794
Yeah, 'cause you've been on edge

575
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:19,563
ever since you vibed me.

576
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:20,831
Are you gonna tell me what you saw?

577
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,132
Yeah, I told you what I saw.

578
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:23,734
No, but, for real.

579
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:25,435
I can tell when you're
not being honest with me.

580
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,471
Am I her?

581
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:31,175
Yeah.

582
00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:32,676
Yeah, you're her.

583
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:35,312
I... I saw the both of us

584
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:36,880
fighting.

585
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:41,785
Like, full-on Vibe versus Killer Frost.

586
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:45,155
It's like we're meta-frenemies.

587
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:47,491
Well, have you ever vibed
anything from the future

588
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:50,394
that didn't come true?

589
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,663
Just Earth-2 being ripped to shreds.

590
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:54,831
But that doesn't mean
that can't happen again.

591
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,234
Caitlin,

592
00:21:57,236 --> 00:21:58,502
you have to tell them.

593
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:00,204
You have to tell the team.

594
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:01,471
We have to figure out what's going on.

595
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:02,573
No. It's too late.

596
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:04,675
There's nothing you can do.

597
00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:06,076
Nobody else needs to know.

598
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:12,182
I haven't been to a movie in forever.

599
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:13,717
I come whenever I can, I mean,

600
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,452
sort of a summer tradition with the kids.

601
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:17,087
Yeah?

602
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:18,355
You know, it's funny,
you don't really peg me

603
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:20,023
for a, uh, horror movie type.

604
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:22,159
I thought maybe you'd be
more of a chick-flicky.

605
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:24,127
- Oh, you got jokes.
- Yeah.

606
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:25,762
I might be mad if you weren't so gorgeous.

607
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:29,466
Gorgeous, really?

608
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:31,101
If I'm so gorgeous, then how come you're

609
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:33,704
spending more time looking
at that than you are at me?

610
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:34,972
You know what?

611
00:22:34,974 --> 00:22:37,541
You're right, Cecile, I'm sorry.

612
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:39,176
My son, Wally,

613
00:22:39,178 --> 00:22:41,211
he's...

614
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:43,647
going through some changes and I'm just...

615
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:44,982
- Hey.
- Just really concerned.

616
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:46,683
Joe, we can do this another time.

617
00:22:46,685 --> 00:22:48,452
No-no-no-no, I really
want to be here with you, I do.

618
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:51,021
It's just that when
one of my kids is hurting I'm...

619
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:53,724
Can't think about anything else at all.

620
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:55,692
Completely understand.

621
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:57,461
- You have kids?
- Yeah.

622
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:58,795
- Daughter.
- Oh.

623
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:00,530
Just turned 18.

624
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:02,633
I have less than a year before
she leaves me for college.

625
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:04,801
Oh, man, you should have brought her.

626
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:07,704
I drag you away from her
so you can watch a horror movie.

627
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:10,207
Not many men could.

628
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:13,176
I'm just glad you finally
figured out what you want.

629
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:14,611
Me too.

630
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,717
Wally, you okay?

631
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:28,925
- I hate that we have to do this.
- Mm.

632
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:31,662
He so badly wanted powers,
and, now, to keep him locked up

633
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:32,896
so he doesn't get them, it's...

634
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:34,331
It's hard, I know.

635
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,967
I don't know if you actually do.

636
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,669
What does that mean?

637
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:41,138
All Wally wants to do is to help people.

638
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,174
And to see you do that every day
while all he can do

639
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:45,709
is stand by and watch,

640
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:48,045
it's hard being a bystander sometimes.

641
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:53,417
You don't feel that way too, do you?

642
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,886
Barry...

643
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:57,521
Come on.

644
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:00,357
My contributions here are limited.

645
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,725
I don't know science.

646
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:03,160
I don't have powers.

647
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:06,563
I don't know how to help you.

648
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:09,800
I couldn't do this without you.

649
00:24:09,802 --> 00:24:10,801
That's not true.

650
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:13,236
That is true.

651
00:24:13,238 --> 00:24:15,972
Whether you realize it or not,
there is no Flash

652
00:24:15,974 --> 00:24:18,508
without Iris West.

653
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:24,348
I'm wolfing this.

654
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,083
- I'm telling you, it's so good.
- It is good.

655
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:27,984
What is it about popcorn and the movies?

656
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:29,052
Hey, you okay?

657
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:30,220
- Hey.
- Yeah, fine.

658
00:24:30,222 --> 00:24:31,788
- Hi, I'm Caitlin.
- Hi.

659
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,457
Cecile. Nice to meet you.

660
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,058
And you must be Cisco. That's me.

661
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,426
Nice to meet you. Hi.

662
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:37,361
Don't forget about me.

663
00:24:37,363 --> 00:24:39,463
Hello.

664
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,565
I'm HR.

665
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,633
HR Randolf.

666
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:45,102
It's amazing to meet you.

667
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:47,838
- All right, now.
- Amazing.

668
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,974
And so then... then she says to me,

669
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:53,610
"Oh, so you are hot chocolate
from another land."

670
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:54,778
I said, "Okay, easy, now."

671
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,346
Then she, "Wait a minute.

672
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:58,515
Do you speak a foreign language?"

673
00:24:58,517 --> 00:24:59,516
What did you say?

674
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:01,852
Well, I said, "Sure."

675
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:04,688
"As long as I know the words."

676
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,024
"As long as I know the words."

677
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:11,528
I'm gonna smack somebody.

678
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:25,575
Everybody, move, move!

679
00:25:34,453 --> 00:25:35,952
It's Shade.

680
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:37,254
He's at Hofherr Park.

681
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:40,690
Wallace.

682
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,727
Wallace West.

683
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:47,397
The time has come

684
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:51,568
to restore what was taken from you.

685
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,104
The time has come

686
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:56,173
to set you free.

687
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:15,855
Hey, hey, the same thing
happened to Frankie.

688
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,323
You have to fight through the pain.

689
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:26,199
Are you okay?

690
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:27,467
I think so.

691
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,279
Find me.

692
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:42,148
And I will release you from all of this.

693
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,216
Wally, what is it?

694
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:45,051
You have to open the door.

695
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,953
I... I can't do that, Wally. I can't.

696
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:50,290
I can make you whole again.

697
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:52,158
Open the door! I need to get out!

698
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,326
Now!

699
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:09,342
Flash, just who I came to see.

700
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:11,811
So you like shadows?

701
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,546
Want to try and catch mine?

702
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,966
Barry, we're in the van. Can you hear us?

703
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:36,235
And I just got tossed
on my ass like a rag doll.

704
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,203
That's not good.

705
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:38,705
All right, guys,

706
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,573
I cannot do anything if I can't see him.

707
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,375
Can we light this place up?

708
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:44,210
Light's gonna slow down
his molecular vibration

709
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:46,012
so we can catch him.

710
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:47,747
How are we gonna light this place up?

711
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,248
- See all these cars?
- Yeah.

712
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,850
- I hack into their computers.
- Yeah?

713
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,785
- The park's overhead lights.
- Yeah?

714
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:54,020
Blast this guy with more lumens

715
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:55,955
- than a Pink Floyd concert.
- Yeah.

716
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,057
What are you doing?

717
00:27:58,059 --> 00:27:59,158
He's gonna need these.

718
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:02,962
- She took...
- She took the cuffs.

719
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:04,497
Okay, just drop it, all right?

720
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:05,598
Barry, I'm in.

721
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,266
Okay.

722
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,469
All right, wait until my mark.

723
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:10,937
And by mark,

724
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,205
I do mean

725
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:13,806
next time that I get punched.

726
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,943
Mark.

727
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,520
Flash!

728
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,468
Don't like the light, do you?

729
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,103
Nowhere to hide now.

730
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:48,441
Get me out. Get me out... ah!

731
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:56,482
Help me!

732
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,284
Please, make it stop.

733
00:28:58,286 --> 00:28:59,318
Ah, Iris!

734
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,220
Hey, Wally, Wally, Wally, look.

735
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,622
It's over, okay? Come on, come on...

736
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:05,825
Find me.

737
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,127
Stay out of my way.

738
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:11,497
Wally, stop.

739
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,832
Stay out of my way!

740
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,506
Wally wasn't himself.

741
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,108
He was possessed.

742
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,509
Alchemy was calling for him.

743
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,811
I knew I shouldn't have left.

744
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,712
It's okay, Joe, nothing happened.

745
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:28,414
He's not okay, Barry.

746
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,849
This thing's coming after him, and...

747
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,050
and there ain't a damn thing we can do?

748
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,351
Well, we stopped Shade.

749
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,120
And now we can focus on Alchemy, all right?

750
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:36,155
Unless he sends another meta
to Central City to attack.

751
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:37,423
Then we're in trouble.

752
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:39,058
You think Shade was a distraction?

753
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,860
I agree with Iris;
I think the attack on Wally

754
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,995
and the attack by Shade happened
at essentially the same time.

755
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:44,931
So that's not a coincidence.

756
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,732
If that's true, that means
Alchemy's gonna sending

757
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:47,867
another one of his metas soon.

758
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,001
We don't know that.

759
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:51,237
Barry, we found six husks.

760
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,739
So besides Shade, Magenta, and Clariss,

761
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,508
there's still three unaccounted for.

762
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,643
Okay, well, if more come,
then we'll stop them.

763
00:29:57,645 --> 00:30:00,813
But Alchemy can't get Wally
if he stays in the cell.

764
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:02,682
Barry, we can't just let
Wally suffer in there.

765
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:04,350
And besides, burying our head in the sand

766
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:07,386
is not gonna make Alchemy go away.

767
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,990
Ignoring the problem does not get rid of it.

768
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,058
You're gonna have to face it.

769
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,161
Don't we?

770
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,897
- What?
- Nothing.

771
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,732
Come on, Caitlin.

772
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,300
Not right now, Cisco.

773
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,436
I... just... I can't just keep this in.

774
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:25,371
You have to tell them.

775
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:26,506
Tell them what?

776
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,512
I have powers.

777
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:33,913
What?

778
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,815
What kind of powers?

779
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,818
The cold kind.

780
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:45,158
Happy now?

781
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,560
So, what, we're just gonna
keep secrets from each other?

782
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,295
Yeah, well, this wasn't your secret to tell,

783
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:50,563
was it, Cisco?

784
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:51,998
I did that because I care about you.

785
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,332
If you cared about me, then you would have

786
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:54,634
let me tell them all when I was ready.

787
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:57,270
Because this is happening to me, not you.

788
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,138
I'm the one turning evil.

789
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,074
I'm the one who's gonna have to leave soon.

790
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,951
I vibed the two of us fighting
each other in the future.

791
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,887
She was Killer Frost.

792
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,656
- I'll go talk to her.
- I got it.

793
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:40,446
How long have you known?

794
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:42,415
A few months.

795
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:47,353
First I didn't want to accept
what was happening to me.

796
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,121
And then I had to.

797
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:52,658
So then I tried to suppress my powers.

798
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:57,430
There's no suppressing these powers.

799
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,601
I just can't believe that this is my life.

800
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:04,003
It shouldn't be.

801
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,706
None of what's happening
to any of you should be.

802
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,541
What do you mean, any of us?

803
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:11,143
I mean...

804
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:12,812
Dr. Alchemy.

805
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,247
Wally.

806
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:16,515
You getting powers.

807
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,018
Even Dante being dead in this timeline.

808
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:24,223
It's all because I created Flashpoint.

809
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:27,093
Even Iris, who, I don't know, I think

810
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:29,228
she's disappointed that
she doesn't have powers

811
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,263
and everyone else does.

812
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,731
And no matter what I do now,

813
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:34,267
everything's different.

814
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:36,202
So none of this happened before?

815
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:43,109
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

816
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:45,378
Wally's up.

817
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,512
Okay.

818
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:51,851
How you feeling?

819
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,419
I've been better.

820
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:54,654
What do we do?

821
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:56,822
We got to come up with something.

822
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:57,823
Use me.

823
00:32:57,825 --> 00:32:59,692
No. No, no, hell no.

824
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:02,495
Alchemy's calling for me to go to him.

825
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:04,997
Follow me wherever he is,

826
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,465
and we can stop him.

827
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:09,268
No. We're not asking you to do that.

828
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,703
This is our chance to stop him

829
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:11,704
We have to do it.

830
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:13,205
Wally...

831
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:16,108
Dad, he... he wants me.

832
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,476
He's hurting me.

833
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:18,744
So let me fight back.

834
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:23,215
Wally?

835
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:32,639
Find me.

836
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:34,975
Turn him on his side.

837
00:33:34,977 --> 00:33:36,409
All right, get him over, come on.

838
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,011
This should help.

839
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:39,045
It's a mild sedative.

840
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:40,247
- What is that?
- Lorazepam.

841
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:41,781
It works on seizures.

842
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:43,350
Hopefully it'll work on whatever this is.

843
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:45,352
These episodes keep happening
more frequently.

844
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:47,020
Yeah, and this is just a temporary fix.

845
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,355
If we don't stop it too, he could suffer

846
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:50,390
from permanent brain damage.

847
00:33:50,392 --> 00:33:51,958
We don't have a choice.

848
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,426
We have to do what Wally wanted; we have to

849
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:54,861
use him to find Alchemy.

850
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:56,396
No, we're no... it's too dangerous.

851
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:58,765
So is doing nothing.

852
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,367
Need I remind everyone that Dr. Alchemy

853
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:02,269
has a rock that shoots lasers, so who knows

854
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:03,570
what he has up his sleeve?

855
00:34:03,572 --> 00:34:04,771
Cisco's right.

856
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:06,306
What if we're walking into a trap?

857
00:34:06,308 --> 00:34:08,041
You guys aren't walking into anything.

858
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,776
You guys are gonna stay here.

859
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:11,111
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right.

860
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:11,946
What does that mean?

861
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,652
It means that if I'm
gonna put Wally at risk,

862
00:34:13,654 --> 00:34:16,588
I'm gonna use everything
in my power to protect him.

863
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,137
Double-check your packs.
Make sure we have everything.

864
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,372
- Good to go.
- Okay.

865
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:26,877
So what's the plan, Detective?

866
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,647
This lunatic, calls himself Alchemy,

867
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,348
he's the one responsible for all these husks

868
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,917
we've been finding all over town.

869
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,419
But we believe we found a way
to get his location.

870
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,588
How?

871
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:41,625
By using his next target.

872
00:34:41,627 --> 00:34:43,160
Your son?

873
00:34:43,162 --> 00:34:44,495
We'll stop him, Joe.

874
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:50,067
Where's Julian?

875
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,435
He didn't come in today.

876
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:52,870
What, he never misses a day. You call him?

877
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:55,139
Yeah, it went straight to voicemail.

878
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:56,907
Well.

879
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,975
All right, gents, move out.

880
00:34:57,977 --> 00:34:59,310
Let's roll.

881
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:00,444
All right, be safe.

882
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:03,581
We'll see you in a few.

883
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,015
You ready?

884
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,484
Yeah.

885
00:35:06,486 --> 00:35:08,686
Hey, you remember when
I said that you remind me

886
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:11,122
of myself as a kid?

887
00:35:11,124 --> 00:35:12,556
I was never this brave.

888
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:18,195
They've just left.

889
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:21,298
I'm almost done. I'll be right there.

890
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,302
Cisco, I am so sorry about how I reacted.

891
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:28,105
I understand why you told everyone.

892
00:35:28,107 --> 00:35:30,174
Never helps when we
keep things from each other.

893
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,375
You're right.

894
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:35,113
And I'm glad that you told everyone.

895
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:38,745
I'm just not very good at asking for help.

896
00:35:38,747 --> 00:35:41,148
I get that from my mom.

897
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,450
You're better than your mother.

898
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:45,318
I don't know.

899
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,487
I'm just so terrified because she said

900
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:49,389
if I keep using my powers, then

901
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:52,292
it'll be impossible to stop them.

902
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,365
Your mother might be
one of the most accomplished

903
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,201
scientists on this planet,

904
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:05,205
but when it comes to the impossible,

905
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:06,406
we're the experts.

906
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:11,778
We're gonna help you, Caitlin.

907
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,014
- Okay?
- Okay.

908
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:16,349
Let's go help Wally.

909
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:17,651
You got it.

910
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:23,990
We're moving in.

911
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:25,726
Just remember, once you get in there,

912
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,760
we're not gonna have eyes

913
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:27,928
Copy that.

914
00:36:34,503 --> 00:36:36,837
Of course, dude uses an
abandoned subway to set up shop.

915
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,071
Of course he does.

916
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,372
Where's Grodd when you need him?

917
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:41,074
Gro... Gorilla Grodd?

918
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,143
You have sentient gorillas
on your Earth too?

919
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:45,045
Oh,

920
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:47,180
oh, yeah, yeah, we do, many.

921
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:49,382
Many. Yeah.

922
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:59,059
Come to me.

923
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:00,460
Wallace.

924
00:37:02,297 --> 00:37:03,497
Everybody set?

925
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:04,765
We're good.

926
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,933
Just lead the way.

927
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,253
You okay?

928
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:27,754
Yeah.

929
00:37:27,756 --> 00:37:31,091
It's okay to be scared, Wally.

930
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:33,193
I am.

931
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:34,961
You are?

932
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,130
Keeps me alert.

933
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,533
Then I'm on high alert.

934
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:41,101
Let's do this.

935
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:07,460
Hello, Wally.

936
00:38:17,553 --> 00:38:19,286
Are you him?

937
00:38:21,624 --> 00:38:25,325
Are you the voice I've been
hearing inside my head?

938
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:28,662
I am Alchemy.

939
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:31,732
I've been having visions

940
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:33,200
of another life.

941
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:40,658
Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...

942
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,860
The Flash.

943
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,797
I can give you that back,

944
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:47,732
should you desire it.

945
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:49,734
I just want the pain to stop.

946
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:51,502
It will, child.

947
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:53,538
Whatever you desire,

948
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,773
I will see it so.

949
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,775
Now tell me,

950
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:01,145
do you wish for the life
that was taken from you

951
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:04,816
to return?

952
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:07,785
What I wish for...

953
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:09,987
is all of you gone.

954
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,255
It's a trap!

955
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:23,167
No!

956
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,548
The boy has been chosen, Flash.

957
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:44,956
And you will not stand
before what must be...

958
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:47,959
Ever again!

959
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:50,528
No!

960
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:54,565
Get on your knees!

961
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,000
Now! Don't move!

962
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,301
Don't move! Get down!

963
00:39:58,972 --> 00:40:01,506
On the ground.

964
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:02,807
I said get on the ground.

965
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,946
That was a grave mistake.

966
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,249
- You okay?
- I'll be fine.

967
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:13,417
Wally?

968
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:14,986
Yeah.

969
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:17,855
It's over, Alchemy.

970
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:19,657
Over?

971
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,592
You have no idea

972
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:23,361
what's about to begin.

973
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:36,674
What the hell?

974
00:40:36,676 --> 00:40:37,975
Did you guys see that?

975
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,178
See what?

976
00:40:48,755 --> 00:40:50,321
Go. Get the hell out of here!

977
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:55,493
Wally, move towards the door!

978
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,494
Stick with me!

979
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:00,665
The other way! The other way!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

980
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,766
Wally, go!

981
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,643
You all right?

982
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:15,079
Wallace.

983
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:19,750
Wallace West.

984
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:22,286
Take your power.

985
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,923
Wally.

986
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:26,891
Wally, don't!

987
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:28,092
Wally!

988
00:41:46,312 --> 00:41:47,545
Who are you?

989
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,046
Savitar.

990
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,481
The God of Speed.
